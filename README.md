Sudoku Solver

This project is a simple Sudoku solver written in C++.
The program fills empty cells in a 9x9 Sudoku board using the backtracking algorithm.

The initial Sudoku board is defined inside the code. Empty cells are represented by 0. When the program runs, it first prints the initial Sudoku board and then shows the solved version.

Features:

Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles

Empty cells are represented by 0

Uses backtracking algorithm

Prints the board in a clear format in the console

How to use:

Download the code.

Compile with g++ main.cpp -o sudoku.

Run with ./sudoku.

The program will display the initial Sudoku and the solved Sudoku.

Future improvements:

Allow user input for Sudoku puzzles

Load Sudoku from a file

Add GUI (e.g. using SFML or Qt)
